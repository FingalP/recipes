> The best Mac 'n' cheese recipe I have come across, now even better due to all my tweaks! ðŸ˜… The ingredient quantities are very much flexible - definitely a "taste it and see" kind of situation. 

## Ingredients

### For the sauce:

- 1 Tofu block
- Nutritional yeast | 1 - 1.5 cups 

> I always use the same size cup when I make this recipe - if you don't have anything suitable you can assume that a cup is about 240ml.  
- Vegetable oil | 1 cup
- Unsweetened soya milk | 1 - 1.5 cups
- Garlic | 3-5 cloves
- Paprika | 3/4 tbsp
- Soy sauce | 60ml
- Mustard | 1 tbsp
- Miso | 1 tsp | (optional)
- Lactic acid powder | 1/8 tsp | (or sub in a decent glug of lemon juice)
- Black pepper

### Other:

- Pasta | 600g
- Red onions | 2-3
- Courgette | 1-2 | chopped into quarter rounds
- Fresh spinach | 200-400g
> Feel free to sub these vegetables for others - broccoli could work well, or tomatoes.
- Vegan cheese | to grate on top
- Breadcrumbs | (optional)

## Method

1. Chop the onions into rings, and fry over low heat until caramelised.
2. While the onions are frying, blitz all the sauce ingredients in a blender. Add more garlic/soy sauce/nutritional yeast/soya milk to taste.

> It should be quite a strong, powerfully cheesy taste. More lemon juice gives more tang. Remember, the taste will soften once it goes in the oven! The mixture should be pourable, but quite gloopy.

2. Pre-heat the oven to 200C.
3. Boil the pasta to *very* al-dente.

> It should be edible, but not soft! This will happen quicker than you think, so keep tasting it! This is the secret to creamy mac!

4. Drain the pasta and put in a large oven proof dish, with plenty of room for the sauce.
5. Add the fried onions, raw courgette pieces and fresh spinach, and mix into the pasta.
6. Pour the cheese sauce onto the pasta, and stir thoroughly.
7. Top the dish with breadcrumbs and/or grated cheese.
8. Bake in the oven for 20-30 minutes.

> Or until slightly crispy on top.

9. Serve and enjoy!
